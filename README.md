# Filter location with Kalman filter

This code was written in support of an ArcGIS Blog, [The Science of Where I Am](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/?post_type=blog&p=2816082&preview=true), on location considerations in a geospatial application written with the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for Kotlin](https://developers.arcgis.com/kotlin/). It demonstrates use of a simple Kalman filter to predict locations based on a location, speed and heading.
